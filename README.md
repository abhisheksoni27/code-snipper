## Installation

We are sticking with `yarn` for it's speed but you can use `npm`.

```bash
$ yarn add code-snipper
```

For npm,
```bash
$ npm install -g code-snipper
```
**Note**: If you want to use it as a library in your project, you can remove the optional `-g` flag above.

## Command Line Usage

Let's say you have a JS file with the following contents:

```js
const success = 'false';
while(!success){
    keepWorking();
}
```
To generate an Image for the above code snippet:

```bash
$ copper index.js
```

This will save an image named `index.js.png` with the above JS code.

#### image.js.png

## Syntax

The basic syntax for the `copper` command is,

```bash
$ copper (filename) [options|flags]
```

**filename** : Can be a JavaScript or a JSX file.

**options** : a CLI option (used as `--flag` `value`) 

## Options

## `-t, --theme` : defines theme

To change the theme, pass this argument. To see the available themes, see [themes.md](/themes.md)

```bash
$ copper index.js -t hybrid //uses 'hybrid' instead of default theme
```

## `-f, --font` : defines font

You can use any font pre-installed in your system. (**Google Fonts** support is on the list of things to be added.)

```bash
$ copper index.js -f Raleway //uses 'Raleway' instead of 'Source Code Pro'
```
## `-r, --resolution` : defines resolution(zoomFactor)

This flag changes the size of the image.

```bash
$ copper index.js -r 2
```

## `--fontSize` : defines font size

Change the default font size. (Don't pass in units, or it won't work.)

```bash
$ copper index.js --fontSize 25 Raleway //uses '25px' instead of '20px'
```
---

## Module Usage

**Step 1.** Require the module
```js
const copper = require('code-snipper');
```

**Step 2.** Use it.
```js
copper(fileName, options);
```
#### `fileName` **required**
Name of the file containing the code snippet.
####  `options` **optional**
An object via which you can pass in the following parameters.

* theme &ndash; See Available Themes
* font &ndash; Any font installed on your machine.
* fontSize &ndash; Without units.
* resolution &ndash; Make the image fatter

##### Default `options` object
```js
{
    resolution: 1,
    theme: 'hybrid',
    font: 'Source Code Pro',
    fontSize: 20
}
```
